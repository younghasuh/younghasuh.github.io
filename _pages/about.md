I am the Collections Manager of Ornithology in the Research & Collections Department at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. I manage over 124,000 physical specimens as well as the associated data in our EMu database so they can be used by various researchers, students, and visitors. I set project priorities informed by data and collaborate across departments for collections management, conservation, outreach, and education.

I received my Ph.D. from the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-advised by Drs. John Fitzpatrick and Mike Webster. I conducted all fieldwork at Archbold Biological Station with Dr. Reed Bowman. My dissertation focused on understanding variation in life history strategies and dispersal decisions in the cooperatively breeding Florida scrub-jay. I used long-term historical data and field-collected data, as well as a newly developed tracking technology to study movement leading up to dispersal.
