I currently work as the Collections Manager of Ornithology in the Research & Collections Department at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. I'm passionate about making biodiversity data accessible and available for anyone to use, starting with this [shiny app](https://nhm-birds.shinyapps.io/lacm_birds/) I wrote to easily search through our database by species.

I received my Ph.D. from the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-advised by Drs. John Fitzpatrick and Mike Webster. I conducted all fieldwork at Archbold Biological Station with Dr. Reed Bowman. My dissertation focuses on understanding variation in life history strategies and dispersal decisions in the cooperatively breeding Florida scrub-jay. I used long-term historical data and field-collected data, as well as newly developed tracking technology to study movement leading up to dispersal.
