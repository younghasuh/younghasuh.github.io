I currently work as a Research Data Analyst in the Broadband Mapping Team for the California Public Utilities Commision. My job is to collect broadband deployment and subscription data so that the [CA Interactive Broadband Map](https://www.broadbandmap.ca.gov/) is up-to-date and be used to determine eligibility for California Advanced Service Funds projects, which aims to extend broadband access to 98% of California households by 2032. 

Previously, I was the Collections Manager of Ornithology in the Research & Collections Department at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. I managed over 124,000 physical specimens as well as the associated data in our EMu database so they can be used by various researchers, students, and visitors. I set project priorities informed by data and collaborate across departments for collections management, conservation, outreach, and education.

I received my Ph.D. from the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-advised by Drs. John Fitzpatrick and Mike Webster. I conducted all fieldwork at Archbold Biological Station with Dr. Reed Bowman. My dissertation focused on understanding variation in life history strategies and dispersal decisions in the cooperatively breeding Florida scrub-jay. I used long-term historical data and field-collected data, as well as a newly developed tracking technology to study movement leading up to dispersal.
